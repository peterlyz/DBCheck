## 🌍 Multi-Language Support

DBCheck supports **Chinese (default)** and **English**. All interface text updates automatically when you switch languages.

### CLI Language Switch

```bash
python main.py                    # Default: Chinese
python main.py --lang en         # Switch to English
python main.py --lang zh         # Switch to Chinese (explicit)
```

> The Web UI also has a 🌐 toggle button in the top-right corner. Clicking it switches between Chinese and English. The setting is automatically saved and will be loaded on the next Web UI startup.

### Language Reference

| Parameter | Language | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| `--lang zh` | Chinese | Default language |
| `--lang en` | English | English interface |
| (not specified) | Chinese | Uses the last saved language; falls back to Chinese if no record exists |

> **Note**: The `--lang` parameter only takes effect for the current session and does not overwrite any saved language setting. Switching language in the Web UI persists to `dbc_config.json` and loads automatically on the next startup.

### Manually Modify Default Language

To change the default language without using CLI flags or Web UI, edit the configuration file directly:

```json
// dbc_config.json
{
    "language": "zh"   // "zh" = Chinese, "en" = English
}
```

The config file is located in the same directory as `main.py`.

## 🌓 Theme Switching

DBCheck Web UI supports both **dark** and **light** themes. Click the ☀️/🌙 button in the top bar to toggle instantly — the preference is saved to your browser and restored automatically on next visit.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Default Theme | Dark (GitHub-style color palette) |
| Light Theme | High-contrast light variant for bright environments |
| Persistence | Stored in browser `localStorage`, survives page refresh |
| Zero Config | No CLI flags or config file changes needed |

## AI-Assisted - Detect and Resolve Issues

### AI-Powered Intelligent Diagnosis

Leveraging a fully offline, local **Ollama** deployment, DBCheck analyzes inspection metrics (connection counts, cache hit ratios, slow queries, security risks, etc.) and automatically generates structured optimization recommendations. AI insights are rendered as a dedicated chapter in the report — Markdown content is automatically styled into Word format (bold, code blocks, lists, numbered headings), ready to share with your team or leadership.

| Backend | Characteristics | Use Case |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| `ollama` | Local-only, zero cost, no network dependency | Air-gapped environments, high data-security requirements |
| `openai` | Cloud API (OpenAI / DeepSeek compatible), requires network and API Key | Environments that allow cloud API access |
| `disabled` | AI disabled (default) | Offline environments / AI not required |

> **Online Model Toggle**: In the Web UI **AI Settings** page, enable the "Online Model" checkbox to unlock cloud backends (OpenAI, DeepSeek, etc.). When disabled (default), only local Ollama is available — inspection data never leaves your machine.
>
> **Security Notice**: AI diagnosis is strictly limited to local Ollama (localhost:11434) when online mode is off. When online mode is enabled, data will be sent to the configured cloud API — ensure your API provider's privacy policy meets your requirements.

### Risk Detection and Recommendations

Each risk is presented as a card: **Risk Level (High/Medium/Low) → Issue Description → Remediation SQL (copy-paste ready) → Priority & Owner**. The report automatically aggregates all findings so you can see every pending item at a glance.

### 🔒 P0 Lock Diagnostics (v2.4.4)

> Deep lock analysis with structured reporting — blocking chain visualization, deadlock statistics, long-transaction detection, and actionable fix scripts — now available across all six database engines.

#### Diagnostic Dimensions

| Chapter | Focus | Key Metrics |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **4.1 Lock Blocking Chain** | Identify the root blocker in multi-level wait chains | Blocker SID / lock type / locked object name. Severity tier: ≥60s (critical), 10–60s (warning), <10s (info). `fix_sql` uses correct SERIAL# for precise session termination |
| **4.2 Deadlock Statistics** | Cumulative deadlock counts and trace analysis | Aggregates `v$sysstat` deadlock counter, top-10 current wait sessions, trace file analysis guide |
| **4.3 Long Transaction Detection** | Detect transactions exceeding 60s threshold | Undo block consumption, ORA-01555 risk assessment, termination script with rollback estimate |

#### Per-Database Coverage

| Database | SQL Templates Added | Lock Analysis Dimensions | Causal Templates |
|----------|:-------------------:|--------------------------|:----------------:|
| **MySQL** | +4 (InnoDB lock chain / deadlock / long trx / lock type stats) | 5-dimension (blocker, blocked, lock type, duration, object) | 6 |
| **PostgreSQL** | +4 (blocking chain / deadlock / long trx / lock type distribution) | 5-dimension (blocking PID, blocked PID, lock mode, duration, relation) | 5 |
| **Oracle** | +3 (blocking sessions via v$lock×v$session join / deadlock stats / long trx) | 5-dimension (SID, SERIAL#, lock type, object, seconds) | 5 |
| **DM8** | +3 (V$LOCK analysis / V$TRXWAIT chain / V$TRX long trx) | 5-dimension (TRX_ID, LTYPE, LMODE, BLOCKED, duration) | 5 |
| **SQL Server** | Built-in (sys.dm_exec_requests blocking_chain / deadlock_xml / long-running sessions) | 5-dimension | 4 |
| **TiDB** | Built-in (CLUSTER_PROCESSLIST / DEADLOCKS / TIDB_TRX) | 5-dimension | 4 |
| **IvorySQL** | +4 (PG-compatible, reuses PG lock analysis logic) | 5-dimension (same as PostgreSQL) | 5 |
| **YashanDB** | +3 (V$LOCK analysis / V$TRXWAIT chain / V$TRX long trx) | 5-dimension (same as Oracle) | 5 |

> **Note**: SQL Server and TiDB lock diagnostics are natively integrated through system DMVs / cluster tables and do not require additional SQL templates. All eight engines output structured lock analysis chapters in the Word report.

### Historical Trend Analysis

> Run multiple inspections on the same database, and DBCheck automatically aggregates the data to generate trend charts — spotting gradual changes before they become incidents.

- After each inspection, key metrics (memory utilization, connections, QPS, CPU, etc.) are written to a local **SQLite database** (`db_history.db`), surviving process restarts
- Data is aggregated per database (IP + port + type), retaining up to 30 historical snapshots per instance
- SQLite storage is wrapped by `SQLiteHistoryManager`; the original `HistoryManager` API is fully preserved — no migration needed for existing code
- Graceful degradation: if SQLite is unavailable (permissions, locking), the system automatically falls back to in-memory mode without blocking inspections
- The Web UI provides a **trend analysis page** with line charts and threshold lines
- Side-by-side comparison with the previous run: changes shown with colored arrows (↑ deteriorating / ↓ improving)

### AI-Powered Diagnosis

> Leveraging inspection data, DBCheck calls a local Ollama LLM to generate personalized optimization recommendations — evolving from "problem detection" to "problem resolution".

Comparison of Intelligent Analysis vs. AI Diagnosis:

| | Intelligent Analysis | AI Diagnosis |
|---|---|---|
| Principle | Fixed rules, deterministic offline judgment | Local LLM inference, personalized output |
| Speed | Milliseconds | Depends on model response time |
| Output | Deterministic conclusions + remediation SQL | Natural language recommendations, Markdown auto-rendered to Word |
| Invocation | Runs automatically on every inspection | On-demand (can be disabled) |

**AI Backend Configuration (Web UI Settings):**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Online Model | Checkbox — enable to use cloud APIs (OpenAI / DeepSeek); disabled by default |
| Backend Type | `ollama`, `openai`, or `disabled` |
| API Address | Ollama: `http://localhost:11434`; OpenAI: `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| API Key | Required for `openai` backend (OpenAI / DeepSeek key) |
| Model Name | e.g. `qwen3:30b` (Ollama), `gpt-4o-mini` (OpenAI), `deepseek-chat` (DeepSeek) |
| Timeout | Default 600 seconds (LLM cold start can be slow) |

> ⚠️ When online mode is off, any non-localhost API address is automatically rejected to prevent data leakage.

## AI Chat Inspection 💬

DBCheck supports natural language interaction — start an inspection without manual steps.

Open the **AI Assistant panel** in the bottom-right corner and type:

```

### Slow Query Deep Analysis 🔍

> Beyond basic slow query detection, DBCheck performs multi-dimensional deep analysis — correlating execution plans, I/O patterns, lock waits, and temporary table usage — then feeds the results directly into AI diagnostics for intelligent root cause analysis.

#### What It Does

When a database exhibits slow query symptoms, DBCheck collects the Top N worst-performing queries across multiple performance dimensions, performs automated risk rule analysis, and then invokes the AI advisor to generate targeted optimization recommendations.

#### Data Collection Dimensions

Each database has its own optimized query for capturing the most expensive statements:

| Database | Data Source | Collection Dimensions |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **MySQL** | `performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest` | Execution latency, full table scans, lock waits, temporary tables, sort operations |
| **PostgreSQL** | `pg_stat_statements` | Total time, avg time, I/O time, temp blocks, current long-running queries |
| **Oracle** | `v$sql` | Buffer Gets, Disk Reads, Elapsed Time |
| **SQL Server** | `sys.dm_exec_query_stats` | CPU usage, logical reads, elapsed time, physical reads |
| **DM8** | `V$SQL` | Execution time, disk reads |
| **TiDB** | `information_schema.cluster_slow_query` | Query time, memory usage, scan rows, Coprocessor tasks |
| **YashanDB** | `V$SQL` | Execution time, disk reads |

#### Integration with Inspection Flow

```
checkdb() execution order:
1. getData() → SQL inspection queries
2. checkdb() → Intelligent risk analysis
3. Slow Query Deep Analysis ← NEW (auto-executed after AI diagnosis)
4. context['slow_query_result'] → smart_analyze_* for risk rule evaluation
5. AI Advisor → injects slow_query_top3 + slow_query_count metrics
```

The `SlowQueryResult` container standardizes the output from all database analyzers, ensuring consistent downstream processing regardless of database type.

#### Enhanced Risk Rules

The inspection engine adds database-specific slow query rules:

**MySQL (new rules 17+):**
- `performance_schema` not enabled
- Full table scan detection
- Lock wait ratio threshold
- AI diagnosis injection of slow query findings

**PostgreSQL (new rules 11+):**
- `pg_stat_statements` extension not enabled
- High-latency query detection
- High I/O query detection
- Long-running query threshold
- AI diagnosis injection of slow query findings

#### AI Diagnosis Enhancement

A dedicated `build_slow_query_ai_prompt()` function generates a targeted diagnostic prompt. The AI advisor receives:

- **slow_query_top3**: The three most impactful slow queries (by latency, I/O, or execution frequency)
- **slow_query_count**: Total number of slow queries captured

This enables the AI to provide precise, query-level optimization advice rather than generic recommendations.

#### Output in Report

Slow query analysis results appear in the report's risk chapter, tagged with severity levels (🔴 High / 🟡 Medium / 🟢 Low) and paired with actionable remediation SQL.

## FAQ

### General

1. **Some content is empty or missing**
   When template rendering encounters compatibility issues, the program automatically switches to a fallback rendering mode and still produces a complete report with all key data — usage is unaffected.

2. **Connection failure**
   Verify that the database allows remote access, the user has sufficient privileges, and the firewall permits the relevant port.

3. **SSH collection failure**
   Confirm the SSH service is running (default port 22) and authentication credentials are correct. Some stripped-down Linux distributions lack commands like `lscpu`, causing CPU information to show "not obtained" — this is normal.

4. **AI diagnosis not working**
   - Confirm a valid configuration is saved in Web UI → AI Diagnosis Settings
   - Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
   - Ensure the model is downloaded: `ollama pull qwen3:30b` (larger models recommended; cold start is slow)

5. **Risk recommendations are for reference only**
   Built-in thresholds are based on general best practices. Evaluate them in the context of your actual workload.

### Oracle-Specific

6. **ORA-01017 invalid username/password**
   - For SYSDBA access: check the "SYSDBA" box in Web UI; in CLI, enter `sys as sysdba` (full format) — the tool automatically parses and uses the correct privileged mode
   - Verify the password is correct (case-sensitive)

7. **ORA-00904 / ORA-00942 invalid identifier**
   Some advanced views/columns may not exist in certain Oracle versions (e.g., 11g vs 19c). The tool handles compatibility gracefully; incompatible items are marked with ⚠️ and skipped without affecting the overall inspection.

8. **Do I need to install an Oracle client?**
   - Using `oracledb` driver (recommended): No — pure Python implementation
   - Using `cx_Oracle` driver: Yes — download [Oracle Instant Client](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client.html)

9. **Oracle version support**
   Supports **11g R2, 12c, 19c, 21c** and above. SQL templates are cross-version compatible.

### DM8-Specific

10. **Connection failure (returned a result with an exception set)**
    - dmPython uses lazy connections — a successful connection object creation does not mean the connection is actually established; a probe SQL must be executed via cursor to confirm
    - The tool includes built-in auto-probe logic. If it still fails, check: correct port (default 5236), correct user password, and whether the server allows access from your IP

11. **"Invalid column name" error**
    - DM8's V$ view column names differ significantly from Oracle; the tool has been adapted for DM8实测 column names. If errors persist, please send a screenshot so we can add support.

12. **SSH collection not available**
    - Limited by the Dameng server's OpenSSH version (port 2022), SSH collection is temporarily disabled. System resource information will use the local collector. Local and Dameng server information being inconsistent is expected.

13. **"Server hostname/platform" in the report shows local machine info**
    - A known limitation when SSH collection is disabled; Dameng server system info collection depends on the SSH channel and will be addressed in a future version.

### SQL Server-Specific

14. **Connection failure**
    - Confirm SQL Server allows remote connections (SQL Server Configuration Manager → Network Configuration → TCP/IP enabled)
    - Confirm firewall allows port 1433 (or custom port)
    - Confirm correct authentication mode (Windows Authentication or Mixed Mode)

15. **pyodbc installed but connection fails**
    - ODBC Driver 17 required: install via `curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | apt-key add -` then install mssql-server
    - On Linux: `curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/$(lsb_release -rs)/prod.list | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-release.list`

16. **SQL Server version support**
    - Supports **SQL Server 2012, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2022** and above

## REST API (v2.4.3+)

DBCheck provides a REST API for external tools such as CI/CD pipelines and monitoring systems. API Key authentication is required — create keys in the **API Key Management** page in the Web UI.

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5003/api/v1/health

# Trigger inspection (sync)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5003/api/v1/inspect \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"db_type":"mysql","host":"192.168.1.100","port":3306,"user":"root","password":"****"}'

# Trigger inspection (async, returns task_id)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5003/api/v1/inspect \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"db_type":"oracle","host":"192.168.1.200","service_name":"ORCL","user":"system","password":"****","mode":"async"}'

# Query result
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" http://localhost:5003/api/v1/inspect/{task_id}
```
